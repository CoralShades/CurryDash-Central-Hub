- **Git:** 8 semantic commits + v0.1.0 tag, scaffold removed

### Phase 1: Product Brief Initialization (Step 01)
- **Status:** complete
- Actions: Discovered inputs, loaded Action Plan + Research doc, created output from template

### Phase 2: Vision Discovery (Step 02)
- **Status:** complete
- Key findings:
  - Core problem: Ecosystem fragmentation across 6 Jira projects, multiple repos, expanding team
  - Pain compounds: Context switching + manual reporting + knowledge loss + no self-service
  - Current state: Patchwork of Jira + GitHub + Slack + manual docs + ad-hoc AI
  - Biggest gap: No ecosystem-wide visibility across all CurryDash projects
  - Solution: Unified dashboard + role portals + AI assistant + living docs
  - Differentiators: Domain-specific + AI-native + single-team velocity + perfect timing + 3-layer security

### Phase 3: Target Users Discovery (Step 03)
- **Status:** complete
- Key findings:
  - Primary (daily): Demi (PM), Developers (2-4), QA (1-2)
  - Secondary (periodic): Investors/Stakeholders
  - Future (post-MVP): Vendors, Customers
  - Team size: 4-6 people
  - Onboarding: Currently manual walkthrough by Demi per person
  - Aha moments: Unified view (PM), instant AI answers (Dev), aggregated quality (QA), auto-reports (Stakeholder)

### Phase 4: Success Metrics (Step 04)
- **Status:** complete
- Key findings:
  - 3 user success signals: tool consolidation, self-service answers, onboarding speed
  - Business targets: 20-30% velocity increase (3mo), 2x throughput (12mo)
  - Time baseline: Demi spends 5-10 hrs/week on manual coordination
  - Adoption target: 100% internal team daily within 2 weeks
  - AI metrics: Separate dashboard (queries/day, resolution rate, reports generated, widgets created)

### Phase 5: MVP Scope (Step 05)
- **Status:** complete
- Key decisions:
  - MVP = Auth + Admin Dashboard + Jira/GitHub Integrations + Full AI stack
  - Dashboard: Admin/PM only first, then iterate to role-specific
  - AI scope: Chat + report gen + basic widget gen (full stack)
  - Timeline: 4 weeks aggressive
  - Post-MVP: Role dashboards, docs hub, videos, tours, vendor/customer portals
  - 7 go/no-go gates defined

### Phase 6: Completion (Step 06)
