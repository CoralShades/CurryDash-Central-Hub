Create a comprehensive product brief for CurryDash Central Hub through collaborative step-by-step discovery, using the Action Plan and Technical Research as input.

## Reference
- **Workflow:** `_bmad/bmm/workflows/1-analysis/create-product-brief/`
- **Step Files:** `steps/step-01-init.md` through `step-06-complete.md`
- **Output:** `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/product-brief-CurryDash-Central-Hub-2026-02-17.md`
- **Input Docs:**
  - `CurryDash_Central_Hub_Action_Plan.md` (project vision, architecture, 8-phase plan)
  - `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/research/technical-currydash-mvp-architecture-research-2026-02-17.md` (38+ web search validated architecture)

## Current Phase
COMPLETE — All 6 steps done

## Phases

### Phase 1: Initialization (Step 01)
- [x] Check for existing workflow state — no prior product brief found
- [x] Discover input documents (1 research doc + 1 action plan)
- [x] Load all discovered files completely
- [x] Create output document from template with frontmatter
- [x] Present initialization report to user
- [x] Update frontmatter: stepsCompleted: [1]
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 2: Vision Discovery (Step 02)
- [x] Collaborative problem space exploration
- [x] Deep problem understanding (fragmentation, tool-hopping, manual reporting, knowledge loss)
- [x] Current solutions analysis (Jira, GitHub, Slack, Notion gaps)
- [x] Solution vision (unified dashboard + role portals + AI assistant + living docs)
- [x] Unique differentiators (domain-specific, AI-native, single-team velocity, timing, 3-layer security)
- [x] Executive Summary + Core Vision appended to document
- [x] User confirmed [C]
- [x] Update frontmatter: stepsCompleted: [1, 2]
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 3: Target Users Discovery (Step 03)
- [x] User segment identification (primary daily vs secondary periodic)
- [x] Primary personas: Demi (PM), Arjun (Dev), Priya (QA)
- [x] Secondary persona: Marcus (Investor/Advisor)
- [x] Future users: Vendors, Customers (post-MVP)
- [x] User journey mapping (onboarding, daily usage, success moments)
- [x] User confirmed [C]
- [x] Update frontmatter: stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 4: Success Metrics (Step 04)
- [x] User success metrics (tool consolidation, self-service, onboarding speed)
- [x] Business objectives (3-month and 12-month targets)
- [x] Core platform KPIs, AI assistant KPIs (separate dashboard), integration health KPIs
- [x] Strategic alignment (every metric traces to core vision)
- [x] User confirmed [C]
- [x] Update frontmatter: stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4]
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 5: MVP Scope Definition (Step 05)
- [x] Core features: Auth + Admin Dashboard (W1-2), Integrations (W3), AI (W4)
- [x] Out of scope: Role dashboards, docs hub, videos, tours, external portals
- [x] MVP success criteria: 7 go/no-go gates
- [x] Future vision: 5 phases through 2-3 year north star
- [x] User confirmed [C]
- [x] Update frontmatter: stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 6: Completion (Step 06)
- [x] Workflow completion announcement
- [x] bmm-workflow-status.yaml updated (product-brief → file path)
- [x] Document quality check
- [x] Next steps guidance
- [x] Update frontmatter: stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- **Status:** complete

## Post-Brief Next Steps
- [ ] Next: PRD (`/bmad:bmm:workflows:prd`) — detailed requirements from this brief
- [ ] Optional: UX Design (`/bmad:bmm:workflows:create-ux-design`) — can run parallel with PRD

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use Action Plan + Research as inputs | Most comprehensive existing documentation |
| Internal team first, external post-MVP | 4-6 person team gets immediate value; vendors/customers can wait |
| Admin/PM dashboard first, then iterate | Proves concept before building 4 role variants |
| Full AI stack in MVP (chat + reports + widgets) | AI is key differentiator, not a nice-to-have |
| 4-week aggressive timeline | AI-assisted development + BMAD methodology enables speed |
| Separate AI metrics dashboard | AI features are primary differentiator, need dedicated tracking |
