            Review this PR for the CurryDash Central Hub project. Check for:

            1. **TypeScript strict mode compliance** — no `any` types, proper error types
            2. **Spice-themed design tokens** — no hardcoded hex colors, use CSS custom properties
            3. **Role-based access control** — three-layer RBAC (middleware, server component, RLS)
            4. **Server/Client Component boundaries** — `"use client"` only at leaf nodes
            5. **Zod validation** — input validated at all data boundaries
            6. **Naming conventions** — kebab-case files, PascalCase components, camelCase functions
            7. **Anti-patterns** — no Zustand for server data, no direct API reads on page load

            Be concise and actionable. Focus on issues, not praise.
