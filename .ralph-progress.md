## How This File Works

Each story iteration adds an entry below with:
- **PLANNING** status when the implementation sketch is created
- **COMPLETE** status when the story passes review + QA and is committed
- **BLOCKED** status if the story cannot be completed after max retries

The Ralph orchestrator (ralph-run.md) updates this file automatically during each loop iteration.
